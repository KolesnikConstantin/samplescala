#  Scala examples

This repository contains the code examples about useful libraries and tools for writing applications.

The examples are divided as follows:


 - Useage of [Play framework](https://www.playframework.com) for building web applications. There is a REST API to deliver information about a user's repositories on GitHub and a single-page web application with [D3](d3js.org) graphs.

To run the examples, start by installing [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/tutorial/Setup.html), the (main) build tool for Scala projects.

Once you have installed SBT, download this repository using:

    $ git clone https://github.com/KolesnikConstantin/samplescala.git

You can then navigate to each directory and type `sbt run` in a terminal to run the source code, or `sbt console` to open a Scala console with all the dependencies for that particular project. Read the README for each app for more detail.
